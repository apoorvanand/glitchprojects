Product search demo with instantsearch.js and Algolia
=========================

Searches and facets and filters, oh my!

I bet you're just glitch'n to get started.

This demo shows you how to create a fully-featured, Amazon-like product search experience. It's based on the [instantsearch.js](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/) open source project.

The sly search engine behind the scenes is the [Algolia API](https://algolia.com/). Algolia makes sure your search returns the most relevant results, even if your users are human and do things like make typos.
